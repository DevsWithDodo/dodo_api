                <h4>Adverts & commissions</h4>
                Our website and app may contain adverts. These are served through Google AdMob.
                We do not control the actual adverts seen / displayed.
                Our ad partners may collect data and use cookies for ad

                advertising partner, at no cost to you, whether you make a purchase on their
                website or not.
                We use advertising partners in these ways to help to cover our
                expenses and generate an income which allows us
                to continue our work and provide you with the best
                overall experience and valued information.
                If you have any concerns about this we suggest you do not click on any adverts found throughout
                our services.
